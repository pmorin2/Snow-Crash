Here, we have 2 files called level09 and token

If we try to execute level08, we'll get:
You need to provied only one arg.

If we try "./level09 token", we'll get:
tpmhr

You can see it now, but if you want a more explicit exemple, try "./level09 aaaaa":
abcde

This file will add 1 to the ASCII value of the character, each time it goes forward through the string
aaa will be a + 0 = a | a + 1 = b | a + 2 = c => abc

Now, if we cat the token, we get: f4kmm6p|=�p�n��DB�Du{��
This string was obviously crypted with the file level09, so we have to make an uncrypting script:
<?php
$str = str_split($argv[1]);
$nbr = 0;
foreach($str as $c) {
        echo(chr(ord($c) - $nbr));
        $nbr += 1;
}
echo("\n");
?>

We put this in a file like /tmp/hacked.php
Now, we just have to execute this script with the string inside token:
php /tmp/hacked.php "$(cat token)"

And we get the token: f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
We're not finished, because this token is use to do:
su flag09

Now, we can getflag and get the flag:
Check flag.Here is your token : s5cAJpM8ev6XHw998pRWG728z
