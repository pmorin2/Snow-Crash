Here, we have a file called level13.

When we try to exec it, we get:
UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

We can't change our UID, so we'll need to change the variable durring the running of the program.
In order to  do that, in the video of the project, it is said that we'll need gdb.

So first, we have to exec gdb:
gdb ./level13

then, wi'll get all steps on the main function of the program:
disas main

we can see the two important steps, the 5th and 6th:
0x08048595 <+9>:	call   0x8048380 <getuid@plt>
0x0804859a <+14>:	cmp    $0x1092,%eax

the fist one will get the uid
and the second will cmp $0x1092 and %eax

To change one of those values, we'll first set a breakpoint on the getuid:
b *0x8048380

Then, we can run the program with "run", it will stop at the breackpoint
Now we can make one step using "step" to go to the next line
do it again to  exec the getuid line and get to the cmp line

If everything is ok, we can "print $eax" (our variable) and we'll get 2013 (our UID)
Now we can change it:
set $eax=4242

Then, the last thing we have to do is to make another step to go through the cmp line
You'll see the flag displayed:
your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx
