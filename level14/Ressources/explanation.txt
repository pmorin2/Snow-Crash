Here, we have no file.
Let's try to gdb the getflag like we did before:
gdb getflag

if look at what "disas main" give us, we can see ptrace, which don't allow us to run the program.
so let's set a breakpoint:
b ptrace

Now let's "run" and "step" to get right after the ptrace
If we try to "print $eax" like the previus level, we get -1
We need to change it to 0 to get the ptrace not returning an error (-1):
set $eax=0

But now if we try, it still doesn't work
In the prevews level, we had to deal with getuid, so let's try to set a breakpoint to getuid
b getuid

Now we'll do the same start: "run" => "step" => "set $eax=0"
Then, we'll deal with the getuid, so "step" to get to this breakpoint, then "step" again to go right after
If we look at "print $eax", we can see 2014 which is our id
On another ssh, we can see using "id flag14" that it's id is 3014

So, we'll put 3014 instead of 2014 int $eax:
set $eax=3014

Finaly, just "step" one last time to get your flag:
