To find this flag, we will search for the files that we have acces.
The command: "find /* -user flag00" will search for it
(you can add "2>/dev/null" at the end of the command so avoid printing errors)

The result without errors is :
/rofs/usr/sbin/john
/usr/sbin/john

(thoses files are the same)
If we cat this file, we have: cdiiddwpgswtgt
That looks like a Caesar crypted password because it is not realy long and doesn't contain any number
To decrypt it, you can go on https://md5decrypt.net/Cesar. Here, you can bruteforce all the possible solution.
(in fact, there is only 25)
And for Caesar(15), we can see the result nottoohardhere
That's obviously the password we need to get the flag

so now just do "su flag00" and put the password. You'll be able to execute getflag after this
