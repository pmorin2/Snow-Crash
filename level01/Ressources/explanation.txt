Here, the "find" command from level00 doesn't work.

Passwords are commonly put in etc/passwd.
If we try to cat, we'll see a bunch of trash lines, and the line flag01.
It's the only line which contain a password (which is crypted): flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw
it doen't look Caesar crypted, so we'll use John-The-Ripper (it is indicated as MUST HAVE in the intranet video).

After instaling, we put the login:password (flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw) in a file and we'll do "john {YOUR FILE}".
John will give us the password "abcdefg", which is the one that unlock the flag !
