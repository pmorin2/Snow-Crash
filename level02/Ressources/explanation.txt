Here, we have a file called level02.pcap

First, we have to download it to our VM usic scp:
scp '-P 4242' level02@192.168.1.65:level02.pcap .
note: you'll have to put the flag found before as password

After that, we need to open this file using for exemple wireshark (project's video)
If we look at the data of each line, we'll see one with "Pas sword:"
We just have to take all the caracters till the byte 0d:

66  74  5f  77  61  6e  64  72  7f  7f  7f  4e  44  52  65  6c  7f  4c  30  4c
f   t   _   w   a   n   d   r   DEL DEL DEL N   D   R   e   l   DEL L   0   L

that makes: ft_waNDReL0L

This password will unlock the flag !
